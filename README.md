# SEPT-CPI

This is a very simple webpage graphing out each September's CPI over the last ten years.

I made a json file with each month's CPI. 
Then I fetched it before making every 12th element into a useable array for the chart. 
Then I calculated the differences between sequential months into another array.

The rest was just setting up the chart and adding a small description of what CPI is. Enjoy!
